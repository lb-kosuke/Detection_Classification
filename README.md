## Detection and Classification of Chromosomes with Sister Chromatid Cohesion Defects Using Object Detection Models

This repository will be the sample code for the title paper.


It includes the following

1. Data : Chromosome images of WT cells and CTf18 -/- cells for classification
2. Models : Trained models to classify three classes typeA, typeB, and typeC.
Includes 30 each of ResNet18-based and SqueezeNet-based models
3. Results : This folder contains csv files outputting the classification prediction results for each models.
4. Code : Classification_Demonstration_code.ipynb
This code was created with google colaboratory.

## Usage
1. Open Classification_Demonstration_code.ipynb
2. Click open in colab
3. Click Runtime → Change runtime type → Hardware accelerator　: GPU
4. Run the code in order from the top
5. The parts that can be changed are marked with "###" at the beginning.
